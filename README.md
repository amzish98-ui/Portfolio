# Amir Developer Portfolio

## Project Brief

The goal of this project was to design and build a responsive multi-page portfolio website using HTML and CSS. The website needed to demonstrate clean structure, responsive layout, and deployment using GitHub Pages.

The site includes:
- A Home page
- An About page
- A Projects page
- A responsive navigation bar
- A responsive image gallery
- Deployment via GitHub Pages

---

## Approach

To complete this project, I first created the basic HTML structure for all three pages. I then styled the website using CSS, focusing on layout, spacing, typography, and responsiveness.

### Technologies Used:
- HTML5
- CSS3
- Git
- GitHub
- GitHub Pages

I used Flexbox and CSS Grid to structure the layout and media queries to ensure the site works across desktop, tablet, and mobile screen sizes.

### Biggest Challenges

One of the biggest challenges was making the website fully responsive across different screen sizes. Ensuring that the navigation bar and project gallery adjusted correctly for mobile devices required careful use of media queries and layout restructuring.

Another challenge was maintaining clean and efficient CSS while making multiple design adjustments.

## Future Improvements

If given more time, I would:

- Improve the visual design with smoother animations
- Refactor and optimise the CSS to reduce redundancy
- Add JavaScript for enhanced interactivity
- Improve accessibility (ARIA labels, improved contrast)
- Add more projects with detailed case studies
